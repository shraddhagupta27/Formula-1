        <p style="font-size: 30px; color: #333333;">Formula 1, often referred to as the pinnacle of motorsport, has been gaining unprecedented popularity in recent years. It's not just about fast cars, talented drivers, and competitive teams—it's a world full of drama and excitement that captivates fans across the globe. Historically, F1 attracted a predominantly male audience, but the sport has seen a significant shift under new leadership. In November 2022, F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali revealed that 40% of global F1 fans were women—a remarkable 8% increase since 2017. We, too, found ourselves intrigued by the world of F1 while working on this project. The more we explored the more our fascination grew. And just like us, we hope this journey will spark your curiosity and perhaps turn you into a fan by the end of it!</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px; color: #333333; margin-bottom: 100px;">To bring F1’s story to life, we’ve leveraged a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, which originates from the official F1 website. The dataset is rich with information on constructors, drivers, races, lap times, and more. Verified and detailed, it offers a glimpse into the sport's intricate world.</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 30px; color: #333333;">Our journey begins with the foundation of F1: the circuits.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 30px; color: #333333;">Circuits are the heartbeat of Formula 1. They are where the action unfolds, and each track has its own personality—from the tight corners of Monaco to the high-speed straights of Monza. Understanding where races are held over the years gives us a clear picture of how the sport has expanded globally. Our first visualization focuses on the countries hosting F1 races over the years and the number of races held in each. This animated choropleth map shows the progression of F1's global reach, emphasizing its expansion into new territories and the increasing diversity of its calendar.</p>
